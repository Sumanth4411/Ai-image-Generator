#NAME=S.SUMANTH KUAMR




#DESCRIPTION=The AI Image Generator is a web-based application designed to convert textual prompts into high-quality, AI-generated images using state-of-the-art generative models. It provides users with an intuitive interface where they can input descriptive text, select from models like Stable Diffusion XL or Kandinsky, and generate multiple images in varying aspect ratios. The tool supports voice input for hands-free creativity, as well as drag-and-drop functionality for prompt files. A sleek theme toggle enables users to switch between light and dark modes, enhancing visual comfort. The frontend is built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and FontAwesome, ensuring a modern and responsive layout. The app features smooth animations, accessible design, and real-time feedback for an interactive user experience. Modal previews allow users to enlarge and inspect generated images. Behind the scenes, the app communicates with backend APIs to process text prompts and return visual results. This project reflects the fusion of AI and web development, demonstrating how generative AI can be deployed in creative tools. It also emphasizes user-centered design, responsive layout, and cross-device accessibility. The use of dropdowns for model, image count, and aspect ratio adds customization control for varied outputs. Form validation and ARIA labels ensure accessibility and usability for all users. The inclusion of a history list allows users to revisit previous prompts. This project stands as a testament to practical applications of machine learning in web apps. It integrates both technical robustness and visual appeal, showcasing future-ready AI interfaces. The voice prompt feature bridges the gap between traditional text input and conversational interaction. The project lays a foundation for expansion, such as downloading images, image editing, or saving user sessions. Overall, it is a powerful demonstration of how AI can empower human creativity through technology
